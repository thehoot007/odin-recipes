    <h3>Lasagne</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb fresh lasagne sheets</li>
      <li>2 balls mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Ragu</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Finely chop the carrot, onion and celery and saute the vegetables gently
        in a large frying pan with the olive oil. Once the vegetables are soft
        add the beef and pork mince and cook until browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is much excess fat in the pan, spoon some out. Add the red wine
        and reduce by half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the wine has reduced, add the passata, tomato paste, bay leaves, 4
        cups of beef stock and a pinch of salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir everything together and leave to simmer on low heat for 2.5-3 hours
        uncovered. Add the rest of the beef stock half way through.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>White Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the butter to a saucepan and cook until melted and bubbling.</li>
      <li>
        Add the flour to the melted butter and stir to form a paste. Let the
        flour cook for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slowly whisk half of the milk into the butter and flour constantly
        whisking to avoid any lumps. Once it has started to thicken add the rest
        of the milk, nutmeg, parmesan and a pinch of salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue to heat the sauce whilst stirring until thickened enought to
        coat the back of a wooden spoon. Take off the heat and set aside.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Assembling the Lasagne</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350&#8457; (180&#8451;)</li>
      <li>
        To assemble the lasagne, spoon a small amount of ragu on the very bottom
        of the baking dish. Top with an even layer of lasagne sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a few more spoons of ragu so the pasta is completely covered,
        followed by 2 ladels of white sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the layers of pasta, ragu and bechamel sauce until everything is
        used up making sure to keep enough white sauce for the very top layer
        (you should have 4-5 layers of pasta).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the top layer of lasagne with torn mozzarella and then bake in the
        oven for 45 minutes or until bubbling and golden.
      </li>
      <li>Let it cool slightly for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
