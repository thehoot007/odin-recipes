    <ul>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>&frac12; cup caster sugar</li>
      <li>&frac12; tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>8 oz mascarpone</li>
      <li>1&frac14; cups hot espresso</li>
      <li>6.5 oz lady fingers, pavesini, or savoiardi biscuits</li>
      <li>Cocoa</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Beat yolks and sugar in stand mixer or electrc beater on speed 6-7 for
        10 minutes or until it changes from yellow to pale yellow and is thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add vanilla and mascarpone, beat until just combined and smooth.
        Transfer mixture to a bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clean bowl and whisk. Add egg whites and beat until stiff (3 minutes on
        speed 7).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add &frac12; the cream mixture into egg whites. Gently fold through.
        When most incorporated, add the remaining cream mixture and fold through
        until just combined &mdash; don't bash out all the air in the egg
        whites!
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix cofee and liquor together. Quickly dip biscuits in and line the
        bottom of a 8" square dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprea over half the cream, then top with another layer of coffee-dipped
        biscuits.
      </li>
      <li>Spread with remaining cream.</li>
      <li>
        Cover and refrigerate for at least 4-5 hours, preferably overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust with cocoa powder just before serving &mdash; either before you cut
        or after plating.
