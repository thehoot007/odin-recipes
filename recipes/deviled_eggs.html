    <ul>
      <li>12 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deviled Eggs Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 tsp Tabasco or other hot sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>tsp mayonnaise , whole egg mayo preferred, or kewpie</li>
      <li>1/4 heaped teaspoon cooking salt / kosher salt</li>
      <li>50 g/ 3 tbsp cold unsalted butter , cut into 1 cm / 0.2″ cubes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Garnish</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Paprika, regular, sweet, or smoked</li>
      <li>1 tbsp chives, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Hard boil eggs with centred yolks:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Large pot &#8212;</strong> Bring a large pot with 15cm/6 water
        to the boil. Lower eggs in gently using a spider or slotted spoon. Lower
        heat a tiny bit if needed to stop the eggs from jostling around so much
        they crack.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Boild and swirl &#8212;</strong> Boil eggs for 10 minutes. Swirl
        the water every minute for the first 6 minutes, using the handle of a
        wooden spoon. Give the water 4 or 4 fast stirs in one direction to make
        the water and eggs swirl in the water. The centrifugal force will make
        the yolks cook centred in the egg white (i.e. no thin broken egg white
        walls)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Peel &#8212;</strong> Fill a sink with cold tap water. Remove
        eggs from the boiling water using a slotted spoon or spider. Leave for 5
        minutes until cool enough to handle. Tap the base then peel underwater.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Fill devilled eggs:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Remove yolks &#8212;</strong> Cut the eggs in half and remove
        the yolks using a teaspoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Filling &#8212;</strong> Place the yolks and all filling
        ingredients <em>except</em> butter in a small food processor. Blits
        until yolks are broken up. Add butter and blits, scraping down the sides
        as needed, until the butter is blended through. The filling should be
        creamy (smear with back of spoon to check).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Choose</strong> the best 18 to 20 egg white halves. Brush yolk
        crumbs off the cut surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pipe &#8212;</strong> Transfer filling into a piping bag fitted
        with a nozzle of your choice. Fill so it's mounded.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sprinkle</strong> with paprika and chives, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
